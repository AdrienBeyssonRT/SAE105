# Usage Guide for the Provided Python Script

## Overview
This Python script performs data extraction and analysis based on the content of a file named "DumpFile.txt." It processes the data, extracts relevant information, and generates a CSV file ("test.csv") along with an HTML representation of the data.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tabulate pypandoc
```

## Script Execution
1. **File Input:** Place the "DumpFile.txt" in the "public" directory. This file should contain the data to be processed.

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
   Replace "script_name.py" with the actual name of your Python script.

3. **Output Files:**
   - The script will create a CSV file named "test.csv" containing extracted data.
   - An HTML file named "test.html" will be generated from the CSV file.

## Data Extraction
The script reads each line from "DumpFile.txt" and extracts specific information based on the condition that the line starts with '11:42'.

The extracted data includes:
- Date
- Source IP
- Source Port
- Destination IP
- Flag
- Sequence Number (SEQ)
- Acknowledgment Number (ACK)
- Window Size (WIN)
- Options
- Length

## Visualization
The script generates a line graph using Matplotlib to visualize unique destination IP addresses. The graph is displayed after script execution.

## Additional Notes
- If "DumpFile.txt" is not found, a message will be displayed.
- The script uses NumPy for array manipulation, Matplotlib for graph plotting, Tabulate for table formatting, and Pandoc for text conversion.

Feel free to customize the script according to your needs or integrate it into your workflow.

For any issues or questions, please refer to the script's comments or seek assistance from the script's author.
